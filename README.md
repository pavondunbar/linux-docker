# Docker Shell Script
A Bash shell script written by Pavon Dunbar that does the following:

1. Searches the Docker hub for Docker images based on a search term the requestor enters in the prompt.
2. Pulls the docker image and installs it on the requestor's server.
3. Asks if the requestor wants to remove the image from the server.

To run the script just type either of these commands in Linux:

1) ./docker.sh
2) bash docker.sh
3) sh docker.sh
